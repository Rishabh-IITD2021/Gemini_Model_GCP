Digital Experience,B2E - Elevate employee experiences built on DX,"Event Stream 
 ","To create an engaging experience end-users can receive updates on what is happening in their sphere of influence; from colleagues, content they follow, applications that require attention or events that need a response.

The event stream consolidates the incoming stream of updates and gives the end user an easy digestible view into what is happening in their work environment.

Digital Experience,B2E - Elevate employee experiences built on DX,"User Generated Content Service (UGC) 
 ","Wikis, Blogs and simple pages are all means by which end users can create content that is meant for internal consumption by other users without the rigor of corporate driven and highly regulated content.
Collaboration is what drives this type of content creation - users can crate their personal Blog, or create a Wiki to keep track of notes and minute to an ongoing project.

The self-publishing service provides a structure for pages that have been created so that other users can easily navigate what has been created.

The main focus is on how easy it is to create content, from simple templates that define the purpose (i.e. Blog, Wiki, page), to embedded rich text editors that focus on easy of use by providing only what is needed. Embedding social features, Like, Comment, Rate are also supported.

Optional approval steps can be added in case information require validation before publishing.ï»¿

Basic understanding & scope of the solution
The People Service acts as a layer on top of an organization's User Directory (LDAP, AD, â€¦). It adds another level of capability and more end-user focused features by going beyond the simple display of email or telephone numbers or handling authentication.

With the People Service we add these capabilities:

Provide SSO authentication (provided by separate SSO service)
Collect, manage and share additional information about a user (e.g. Tags, Pronounciation, Interests, history, and more)
Find a user based on any attribute, also facilitates Expertise Location
Users can self-manage the information in their profile
Ability to create connections between users (follow, invite)
Leveraging AI (e.g. Suggestions, Relationship analysis, ...)
Access via UI and API, documented end-points need to be available
Get updates on events that other users triggered to follow e.g., projects (provided by separate Event Service)
Discuss: User deactivation (including Anonymization and transfer of content ownership) vs. Deleting a user. The PS does not manage content (unlike CNX), so is this concept valid or N/A?




The first MVP of people service will be focusing on developing features like

Auth enabled (Prerequisite)
Enable user profile management
- User provisioning
- User profile field customization
Enable tagging
User's Profile Photo will be fetched & managed.
Enable tagging
Business card functionalities.
Search capabilities.
Helm support.

 ","A mechanism in the Notes ID vault for end users to change the passwords (if any) associated with their entries in the Notes ID vault, then we should take that into consideration when planning for future Domino releases.

"
Domino,Secure Mail for 14.0,"Secure server Id with password and apply the password on server restart (Windows + Linux) 
 ","Securing a server ID with a password is optional, but should be mandantory.
The downside is that you cannot perform an unattended restart of the server ( Domino or / and OS ).

So we need a mechanism to apply the password automatically.

There is at least one 3rd party tool available ( BCC Domino Protect ). Domino Protect does a lot more than just apply the password.
You can also write your own extension manager using cAPI to achieve the goal. This is what I have done.

But I would like to see this functionality as part of the core product code.

The options to create / store the password could be

1. Set a password in the admin client and store it ( encrypted ) in a place where can access it during server restart.
2. Let the code create a random, high complex password
3. Let the code create a random, high complex password based on properties of the used hardware. This would it make more secure, because the password would not have to be stored anywhere on the machine.

Domino,Reduce Technical Debt in 14.0,"Clean up ndext directory to give developers the choice to use newer open source libraries  
 ","The ""ndext"" directory of Domino contains more and more open source and internal libraries that are automatically added to the JVM classpath of web apps (and probably agents as well), e.g.:

* activation.jar => javax.activation version 1.1
* BlueJavaHtmlSanitizer.jar => OWASP HTML sanitizer version 20180219.1
* domino-acf-policies.jar => OWASP ACF policies for Domino
* dlt.jar => com.ibm.dltj, version nightlybuild_DLT7113_HF_2010_05_17_Hursley
* dservlet.jar => lotus.domino.server.*
* dwabl.jar =>com.lotus.dwa.*
* guava.jar => Google Guava version 19.0.0
* ibmdirectoryservices.jar => com.ibm.directoryservices.ldap
* icu4j.jar => ICU4J version 4.0
* jsdk.jar => javax.servlet.* API, version probably 2.4
* liveconn.jar => netscape.javascript.* LiveConnect API for browser applets
* lmgfilter.jar => com.ibm.spamguru
* mail.jar => javax.mail.* API 1.4
* RMEval.jar => com.ibm.amw
* stcommsrvrtk.jar => Sametime Java classes version SAMETIME8.0.2_20081209.0208_WIN32AIXSOLLIN_WESTFORD


As a developer, the libs that hurt the most are the old versions of Google Guava, ICU4J and the OWASP HTML sanitizer.


activation.jar even is a duplicate, because the JDK 1.8 rt.jar archive already contains this API.


Having them in the JDK system classpath by default means we cannot use newer versions in our applications (except for some very experimental Java classloader tricks which also require higher Java privileges than standard XPages web apps have).

Please clean this directory up or find a different implementation approach that lets us use newer lib versions in our apps.

Domino,Technical Debt 12.0.2,"Bring back DOTS support 
 ","DOTS was an important addition in the panorama of the scheduled processes fo Domino.
True, it was cumbersome to have to install the Social Component in order to have DOTS task but overall it was a ""breath of decent fresh air"". Considered the power of update sites, config docs and OSGi plugins, AMgr had definitively become an inferior option.

We developed a few key solutions for our customers and now the support for DOTS has been literally removed from Domino 10. Considered that you decided to stop investing in XPages but you kept it I would have expected you did the same with DOTS.

How I wish it were even slightly improved upon:

* DOTS as core task (no separate installation)

* 1 OSGi environment, not 2 (that is XPages and DOTS managed separately)

* See IDEAAD-I-88 (https://domino.ideas.aha.io/ideas/IDEAAD-I-88) for other useful ideas

It's truly disheartening to see DOTS gone after all the efforts that we put into building solutions for it.
At the moment we are strongly discouraging our customers from ever upgrading to V10 because we don't have alternative solution but to stick with Domino 9.

Domino,Technical Debt 12.0.2,"Linux: Support SELinux in Enforcing Mode 
 ","SELinux is almost 20 years old now.  Most software that runs on Linux is well integrated into SELinux by this time and Domino should be, too.

I would add that I've been routinely ignoring that instruction for quite a few years now and never seen an AVC Denial in CentOS nor RedHat Linux Enterprise. Maybe all that needs to be done is some testing to validate that installing and running Domino on Linux with SELinux in Enforcing mode does not cause known problems and is, therefore a supported configuration. This would enhance Domino's reputation in Security. See Promote Domino as the most secure thing on the planet (https://domino-ideas.hcltechsw.com/ideas/DOMINO-I-959) .

Clarification:

So to clarify, what I'm asking for in this ""idea"" is for Domino support for SELinux by HCL testing installation and runtime of Domino with SELinux in Enforcing/Targeted mode.

If no errors are observed, then the documentation should state that this is a supported OS configuration.

If any access issues to system objects/files (like the mongodb example in my comment below) occur, then the fix would be implemented in the installation routine or alternately documented in the installation instructions and the knowledge base.

The overall configuration workflow is as clear as mud, likely because the original implementation was fixated on only supporting one specific version of two specific IdPs â€“ IBM TFIM and MS ADFS â€“ and the more advanced SAML 2.0 support added in V10 had to be shoe-horned into that original limited framework.


Case in point: When I tried to configure Web Federated Login and Notes Federated Login on my test server to start working on Nomad Federated Login â€“ despite having full access to product documentation and the source code â€“ I spent days fighting with the configuration before inviting the entire core security/admin team into an hour-long meeting where even the some of the people who were on the team that designed and implemented that functionality were reduced to guessing at how to correctly configure it.


The best way to accomplish this simplification could involve a wizard of some kind to walk the end user through collecting the correct information and depositing it into the correct fields in the correct order.

Domino,Reduce Technical Debt in 14.0,"Non-English IMAP Outlook Client ""Sent Item"" and ""Deleted Item"" folders are not being updated 
 ","When connecting to Domino server via IMAP using non-English(Arabic, Korean, etc.) Outlook client, the ""Sent Item"" and ""Deleted Item"" folders are not being updated.

You already have the notes.ini parameter EnableImapFolderSynch=1 (https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0029716) and re-enabled the IMAP support on the database but still these folders are not being updated.

When using Outlook in English language, the Sent and Trash folder is being updated properly.


On Notes/Domino environment, the sent and draft messages are stored in a VIEW called ($Sent) and ($Draft). However on Outlook/IMAP they store the sent and draft mails on a FOLDER. That is why when you check the folder list on designer client you would see folder with an alias of ""IMAPSent"" and ""IMAPDrafts"". These folders are use for IMAP sync by the Domino server.


Outlook client that is not in English is creating new folders that translates to ""Deleted Items"", ""Sent Items"", and ""Junk Mail"".

If you open the database using a Designer client you will see folders created by the user ID you use to setup IMAP.


Since the other folders are created by Outlook, they are not used to sync Sent and Draft mail by the Domino server. This can cause confusion to end users on why those folders are empty. The folders (in English language) ""Sent"", and ""Draft"" can be used to view sent and draft mails.


So it will be great if Domino syncs ""Sent"" and ""Draft"" with the translated folders created by outlook in non- English IMAP outlook Client.

Domino,Reduce Technical Debt in 14.0,"$MessageID disparities for same message to different recipients

Installed Software:

How to reproduce the Email Duplicates:
1. Send and File a mail to an internal recipient and an external recipient.

2. The mail will be filed to iManage; in this case the MSG ID is:
OF1A243DA6.44F8EBF3ONC12582EF.006896D3C12582EF.00693459@externaldomain.org

3. The internal recipient's Inbox filer within Lotus Notes will also file the received mail into iManage -> no duplicate detection.
MSG ID if this mail is:
OF1A243DA6.44F8EBF3ONC12582EF.006896D3C12582EF.006933D7@LocalDomain


Further Information / status (from iManage investigation)

During our investigation of NT-55737, we also see the message id of the document imported by WCS is different from message id of the email imported from the Inbox.
Message id from the EML file in WCS drop folder: <OFD60E6F6D.56B66206-ON6525830D.003E64CD-6525830D.003E6AEC@imanage.com>

Message id of the same email in my Inbox: <OFD60E6F6D.56B66206-ON6525830D.003E64CD-6525830D.003E6ADE@LocalDomain>

Because of this, duplicate detection is failing. If the user imports the message from their Inbox more than once, duplicate detection works fine, as the message id is identical. We're investigating why Domino server would stamp different message ids to different copies of the same message. We're also investigating if a there is a workaround available to work around this issue. I've reach out to Engineering for the current status update that I will share with you.

IBM has reached out to us on behalf of the Customer to develop a possible solution with duplicate email detection; as there is a difference in the MessageID value when comparing the same email from the user's inbox with the one sent to the COM Server. We use the MessageID as a unique identifier in our duplicate detection process.

By Default, when user supplies wrong for more than 10 consecutive times a day, user will get reported error message in notes client. You can adjust the count by using IDVault_Max_Auth_Failures=n Parameter.

But is it possible to have a option or parameter with which, the Notes client don't prompts this error message no matter how many times I make a mistake.

So this will reduce the administrator intervention as bad password cache will be reset after 24 hours from the time you get the error message or Administrator will have to reset the Notes user password from IDVault to reset failed attempts count.

Domino Designer,Stretch Goals,"Support JSON in @Formula language 
 ","Web applications heavily use data in JSON format, in many cases with deeply nested structures. In our applications, we store JSON structures in text fields (Domino R12 will extend the max size of text items, so that there's just an overall limit of 16 MB summary data per doc), but Domino currently has no built-in support to show JSON field values in view columns or use it in NSF searches.

Just mapping JSON key/value pairs to document items 1:1 is not sufficient, because the JSON structures are often deeper than just one level.


Let's say a document contains a text item ""myjsonfield"" with the following JSON content:

{
	""firstname"": ""Peter"",
	""lastname"": ""Miller"",
	""keywords"" : [ ""important"", ""sendnewsletter"" ],
	""companies"" : [

		""year"" : 1979,
		""month"" : 5,
		""day"" : 26
	},
	""address"": {
		""home"": {
			""street"": ""Test street 5"",
			""city"": ""New York""
		}
	}
}


Please add the following formulas so that we can easily parse/extract parts of the JSON object (listed with expected values):

// extract single JSON value via their path in the tree structure:
@JsonValue(myjsonfield; ""address.home.street"") == ""Test street5""
@JsonValue(myjsonfield; ""birthday.year"") == 1979
@JsonValue(myjsonfield; ""keywords"") == ""[\""important\"" : \""sendnewsletter\"" ]""
@JsonValue(myjsonfield; ""keywords[0]"") == ""important""
@JsonValue(myjsonfield; ""address.home"") == ""{ \""street\"" : \""Test street 5\"", \""city\"": \""New York\"" }""

// get the type of JSON structure values:
@JsonValueType(myjsonfield; """") == â€žjsonobject""
@JsonValueType(myjsonfield; ""address.home.street"") == â€žstring""
@JsonValueType(myjsonfield; ""address.home"") == â€žjsonobject""
@JsonValueType(myjsonfield; ""birthday.year"") == â€žnumber""
@JsonValueType(myjsonfield; ""companies"") == â€žjsonarray""
@JsonValueType(myjsonfield; ""companies[0]"") == â€žjsonobject""

// get the length of JSON arrays:
@JsonEntries(myjsonfield; ""keywords"") = 2

// get a single JSON array item:
@JsonEntry(myjsonfield; ""keywords""; 0) = ""important"";
@JsonEntry(myjsonfield; ""keywords""; 1) = ""sendnewsletter"";

@JsonEntry(myjsonfield; ""companies""; 0) = ""{ \""label\"" : \""ACME\"", \""id\"" : \""ID1\"" }"";
@JsonEntry(myjsonfield; ""companies""; 1) = ""{ \""label\"" : \""HCL\"", \""id\"" : \""ID2\"" }"";

// get all keys of JSON objects
@JsonKeys(myjsonfield; ""address.home"") == ""street"" : ""city""

@JsonKeys(myjsonfield; """") == ""firstname"" : ""lastname"" : ""companies"" : ""birthday"" : ""address""

// return all available JSON paths of subtrees so that we can use them in @transform to traverse the whole JSON structure:

But in a background tab, the old-web-client/old-browser-sdk the polling period becomes every 2 mins. This is due to the documented changes and chrome's throttling of timers: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/timer-throttling-in-chrome-88. Note this is not an issue with newer web-client code, where the documented work-arounds have been employed. These work arounds were not used in the old-web-client/old-browser-sdk.

This affects all customers, doing integration with other products (ex: Connections, iNotes, Verse and any other 3rd party usage).

Work around: This ticket represents the server-side work in v12.0.2-IF1. The work-around is a server-side setting to allow admins to extend the timeout used to detect an inactive user. So in v12.0.2-IF++, a single config item:

SAMETIME_PROXY_SESSIONTIMEOUT=180

This should be able, to be set to some value > 45s, such that the old-web-client/old-browser-sdk will survive running in the background tab for more than 2 or 3 mins.

Side Effects: This removes the ""real time presence"" aspect for all client types where the client is inactive for normal reasons (ex: kills browser, sleeps laptop, out of wifi range, cell range, mobile powered off, airplane mode, etc). In these common cases the remote peers will continue to see the user as active for minutes after disconnecting instead of seconds. Some customers may see this as a flaw or bug, but it's a trade-off due to this work around.

Note: This is not related to v11.6 in any way. V11.6 will be investigated and handled in a different ticket.

Sametime,Security Enhancements,"OIDC support for Nomad integration 
 ","Nomad/Domino integration is requiring OIDC support.

â€“ From Doug C â€“

We are looking to do have our first delivery of Nomad and Sametime integration in Dec (1.0.14) which will have modest integration but it will be a start.

As we dig more, in the short term, there are likely going to be compromises that will be necessary. Longer term collaboration across the teams over the next couple of releases will be needed to provide better user experiences, and a smooth single sign on.

For single sign on, using modern protocols, we'd like Sametime to support OIDC support. We are being told that this is in the backlog, but has not been prioritizied. Question: Can we get this prioritized higher than just in the backlog? (I assume it is not currently being worked based on talking to the team)

Question: Can we also agree across Product Management to prioritize the integration between Nomad, Verse and ST in general and let the teams work out some of the low level details that will entail?

Some specifics from recent dev interactions: (there are and will be more, just a gist some of the conversation)
authorization flows, and how to make that seamless for a user perspective for auto-login
initiation of chats from Nomad, Verse and ST and not having a different Tab or browser window for each experience
I know as we work through specifics, more specific work will be identified. Can you please confirm that this collaboration across the teams is a priority. and has your backing?

 ","There is no possibility to use SAML on mobile devices for IBM Traveler.

It would be great, if mobile users could use their AD credentials to authentificate them, instead of the ibm notes/internet password.

IBM Traveler authentication does not work correctly when the Domino server is configured to use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML).

The means by which the SAML identity provider passes the authentication assertion to Domino is currently unsupported in the IBM Traveler environment.

Traveler,Capacity/Performance Enhancement,"Allow Traveler on single server to serve Verse Mobile and HTMO 
 ","As of today (Traveler 11.0.1+) we are still required to have two separate server in case we need to support both mobile devices (activesync and verse apps) and Outlook desktop clients.

This is, for smaller customers, a limiting factor (but could also make sense for larger customers with branches etc)

The enhancement request and idea is to allow traveler to work in ""both"" modes on a single server.

My ideal deployment scenario is:

* Install domino + traveler
* Enable the traveler service for mobile, outlook or both
* Serve devices and desktop clients from a single server.

I expect that other previous requirement will remain:

1. Active sync can work with remote replicas
2. Outlook support requires a local replica.

1. If the library is not in shipped code, there will be an N in column F. No additional information is necessary. If the library is in shipped code, there will be a Y in column F. Continue to step 2.
2. If the library is In-House, select Y in column G. If the library is not In-House, select N in column G and continue.
3. Determine the source of the library (i.e github repo/website the library was downloaded from). Input the source location in column I and continue.
4. Determine the license that the library falls under and fill it into column H.

Once these steps have been completed for each repo, please attach the completed spreadsheet to this issue, and @ mention Lauren Brown (https://jira01.hclpnp.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=lauren.brown%40hcl.com) in a comment when closing the issue.

 ","Story to contain all Tasks for resolving medium vulnerability issues detected by AppScan in this repo. Note that not all tasks for this story have been created at this time.

The following link is to a spreadsheet containing all of the medium vulnerability fix groups for issues in this repo:

https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/7BC6F408-6B64-4B3B-A231-28D60040B7ED?tenantId=189de737-c93a-4f5a-8b68-6f4ca9941912&fileType=xlsx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fhclo365.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FHCLLabsProjectPhoenix%2FShared%20Documents%2FCode%20Hygiene%2FAppScanResults%2FMedium%2Fluavmiphone_AppScanMediumVulnerablityFixGroups.xlsx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fhclo365.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FHCLLabsProjectPhoenix&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:65e2d1c5ef3443a6b4bf15d065de8ea0@thread.tacv2&groupId=8aaa5f03-5dda-4a3c-8390-8879883d06e9

For each fix group, the number of issues within the fix group is documented. Please note that fix groups with more than 50 issues have been broken up into groups of 50 or fewer issues.

Please follow the following process when working on these vulnerabilities:

1. Open the spreadsheet and find a fix group, (or a section of a fix group with many issues) and add your name to the ""Owner"" section.
2. Create any stories that are needed for the work, and add them to this epic. Add a link to the story in the ""Notes"" section of the spreadsheet.
3. When work is begun, select ""In Progress"" in the  ""Status"" column.
4. Refer to the attached AppScan report for specific information on the issues you have selected to work on.
5. Resolve each Medium severity issue in the fix group (or fix group subset). Any issues that are not Medium severity can be ignored at this time. Each issue can be considered resolved when one of these 4 criteria are met:

1.

a. Code where issue was identified is not included in a shippable product
b. Issue has been fixed
c. Issue is confirmed to be not applicable
d. We have an approved and documented mitigation plan in place

2. Be sure to track which of the 4 resolution criteria applies to each issue.
3. Once each issue is resolved, update the ""Status"" column in the spreadsheet to ""Ready for Test""
4. If all issues in the group have the same resolution, select the appropriate resolution in in the ""Resolution Column"" and any necessary details in the ""Resolution Details Column""
5. If the issues have different resolutions, select ""Mixed"" in the Resolution column. In the ""Resolution Details"" column, note where the specific resolution is documented for each issue (can be included in a jira ticket, or in a separate tab of the spreadsheet).

Note: DO NOT mark the status for any issues as ""Done"", regardless of the resolution type. This will be done by the Code Hygiene team once the issues have been appropriately marked and processed in AppScan.

Note: libraries with a location that starts with .m2 are either external resources or libraries located in our maven artifactory. Additional research may be required to determine where these libraries are being pulled in. The ""mvn dependency:tree"" command may be helpful. This will list out the dependencies pulled in for a particular pom. For these libraries, please see the ""Notes"" column of the spreadsheet, which documents additional repos where these libraries are found. Please work with owners of the stories for those repos to ensure that no builds are broken by updating.

A library can be considered resolved when one of these 4 criteria are met (select the applicable resolution in the ""Resolution"" column of the spreadsheet):

1. Library is not included in a shippable product
2. Library has been updated to a version that no longer contains a vulnerability (record the new version in the ""Resolution Details"" column of the spreadsheet)
3. The vulnerability is confirmed to be Not Applicable (record the reason in the ""Resolution Details"" column of the spreadsheet)
